<p>This year we are running our first Hackergarten at JBCNConf!</p>
    <p>The point is to work on an Open Source of your choice in order to fix a bug, create a feature, write a blog post, create a video, or anything else you might think of that can be a valuable contribution to the chosen project.                            
We'll hack on anything as long as itâ€™s Open Source, no matter the programming language, platform, IDE, etc. This will be a welcoming open space regardless of your skill level. Whether you are an experienced developer, a junior developer or a studernt, you are welcome to join. We guarantee that you'll learn something. 
</p>
                              
<p>
    We will have 2 sessions:
    
    <ul>
    <li>Monday 10:35 - 17:05</li>
    <li>Tuesday 10:35 - 16:55</li>
    </ul>
    
    
    </p>You can join at any time during the sessions and leave at any time. Besides learning from our great array of speakers that you have become accustomed to at JBCNConf, you can also learn from practical participation. We'll keep a running tally of which projects are being worked one at any time.</p>
